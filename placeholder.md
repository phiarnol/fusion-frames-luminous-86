# Placeholder for Logo Image

This file is included to indicate where the logo image should be placed.

The site references a logo file at `logo.png` that would need to be added to the project.

For a complete implementation, you would need to:

1. Create or obtain a logo image for "Fusion Frames"
2. Save it as "logo.png" in the root directory
3. The logo should have a transparent background and primarily use the cyan color (#7EADCF)

The converted website is now fully functional with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, preserving all the design elements, animations, and responsive layouts from the original React/TypeScript implementation.
